# Obsidian Context Toolkit

An Obsidian plugin that provides a suite of tools to help you actively use, assemble, and manage the context surrounding your notes.

While Obsidian is great for connecting ideas, using that rich context can be a manual process. This toolkit aims to automate and enhance that workflow, allowing you to create structured documents, aggregate information, and visualize connections more effectively.

## Current Features (v1.0)

* **Copy Current Page with Linked Content:** Instantly copy the entire content of the current note, automatically embedding the full text of all linked notes. This feature streamlines sharing comprehensive context, ideal for providing AI or collaborators with all relevant definitions and background without manual copy-pasting.

## Roadmap
If you're an Obsidian user and have ideas or feedback, your input is welcome! Please contact me to help shape the future of this plugin.
